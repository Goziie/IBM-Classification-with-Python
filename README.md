# IBM-Classification-with-Python

In this project, you will build a classifier to predict whether a loan case will be paid off or not.

I loaded a historical dataset from previous loan applications, cleaned the data, and apply different classification algorithm on the data. I am going to use the following algorithms to build my models:

- k-Nearest Neighbour

- Decision Tree

- Support Vector Machine

- Logistic Regression

The results is reported as the accuracy of each classifier, using the following metrics when these are applicable:

- Jaccard index

- F1-score

- LogLoss
